    <h1>GPA Calculator</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p id="description">
      &nbsp; &nbsp; This GPA Calculator is a student-created project for the Introduction to Programming FBLA Competition. 
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Use this calculator to calculate your Semester by entering your grade/percentage, credits earned, and course type for each course you have. 
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; This calculator also has additional features such as the ability to calculate your Total GPA and the ability to generate a customizable report of the your GPA information. 
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Features to be added soon include a new Schoology-powered GPA calculator that can access your grades directly from Schoology to more accurately calculate your GPA and perform other tasks. Another feature to be added soon includes a customizable grading scale where the user can change the grading scale to better represent their school's grading system.
      <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Additional help is provided in the FAQ section at the bottom if needed.

<div *ngIf="showQ0">  
<p>Our GPA Report feature generates a Customizable GPA Report using your GPA information. You can customize what information is shown on your GPA Report by selecting what you want from the 5 checkboxes. A GPA Report with all of the options selected would show your cumulative GPA, weighted GPA, unweighted GPA, total GPA, and course details. 
  After you have customized what information you want to see on the GPA Report you can give the file a name and an extension. The file name cannot be an empty string, otherwise, an auto-generated name is given to the file. The GPA Report automatically downloads as a TXT file; however, if you want to download the GPA Report as another file type, then you can change the File Extension box. For example, if you want to download the GPA Report as a Microsoft Word document instead of a normal text file, then you can input "docx" into the File Extension box. Once you're done with all of that, you can click the red button to download your GPA Report. </p>

<h2> Manual GPA Calculation Help </h2>

<div *ngIf="showQ1">  
<p>Follow these steps to calculate your GPA:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find your grades for each of your courses and list them out.
  If you only have percentages, convert your percentages into a letter grade for the simplicity of this guide. You can use our grading scale table to convert your percentages into letters.</li>
<li>List out the number of credits earned for each of your courses along with your grades.</li>
<li>Use our table above to convert your letter grades to points OR if your school uses a different grading scale, ask your school for their own grading scale and use that to convert your letter grades to points.
  .</li>
<li>Add up all your points from each of your courses.</li>
<li>Count up how many total credits you earned for the semester.</li>
<li>Divide the total amount of points by the total amount of credits.</li>
<p>You have now calculated your GPA for the semester.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<button 
  (click)="changeQ2()"> + What affect do AP and Honors courses have on my GPA?</button>
<div *ngIf="showQ2"> 
  <p>AP and Honors courses do not impact your Unweighted GPA, however they are very important for calculating Weighted GPA. AP and Honors courses both add "weight" to your points. What this means is that AP and Honors courses add "extra" points in addition to the points you have already earned for the course. Typically, Honors courses have a weight of +0.5 (meaning 0.5 extra points are added to the amount of points earned for that course) and AP courses have a weight of +1.0. This is the weight that this calculator uses, however this may vary from school to school. Some schools do not give the weighted points if you fail the class, meaning a D or below. Talk to your school to understand your school's specific grading scale in terms of AP and Honors classes.</p>

<button

<div *ngIf="showQ3"> 
  <p>Calculating you total GPA using cumulative GPA is very similar to calculating your semeseter GPA.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get your cumulative GPA and the amount of credits you have earned so far before the semester. If you are having trouble finding this, your transcipt is a good place to look.
  </li>
  <li>Use the same process from calculating your semester GPA to list out your total points & total credits earned for the semester.</li>
  <li>Add your cumulative GPA with your total points, then add all your credits earned before the semester with the ones you earned for the semester.</li>
  <li>Divide the sum of your cumulative GPA and the total points with the credits earned so far to get your total GPA.</li>

<h2> AP & Honors Questions </h2>
<br>

<div class="entry-content">
<button 
  (click)="changeQ4()"> + Should I take a lot of AP and Honors courses?</button>
<div *ngIf="showQ4"> 
  <p>This decision really depends on your needs. AP & Honors courses are often more difficult and have a lot more course load than normal courses, so if you have many extracurricular commitments or you have not performed well in that certain subject previously, take these into consideration when thinking about taking these courses. You should also consider if you have interest in or if you have performed well in that certain subject. Talking to your teacher about this is essential as they probably know your skills the best and can predict how you would perform in a college-like course. Colleges want to see you work hard and succeed, which some students show by taking AP & Honors courses and some students may not need AP & Honors courses to show this.</p>

<button 
  (click)="changeQ5()"> + Is it more important to take more AP and Honors classes or is it more important to have better grades in less challenging classes?</button>
  <div *ngIf="showQ5"> 
  <p>Taking AP & Honors classes and having a good GPA are both very important. Colleges want to see you work hard and succeed by taking AP & Honors classes, however, if you are earning C's in these classes, it shows that you are not ready for those challenging classes. However, if you are earning A's or B's in Honors or AP classes, this is generally more favorable than earning A's in less-challenging courses. It really depends on if the course is suitable for you.</p>

<h2> GPA Importance Questions </h2>
<br>



<div class="entry-content">
<button 
  (click)="changeQ6()"> + What is considered a good GPA?</button>
  <div *ngIf="showQ6"> 
  <p>This question is a bit subjective, as it really depends on your goals for high school. High schoolers should aim for a GPA of 3.3 or higher especially if you are interested in attending top-tier colleges like the Ivy League, since a lot those schools consider 3.3 as a minimum. If you want to challenge yourself or aim for Valedictorian, try going for a GPA of 4.0 or even higher(if your school uses a weighted GPA scale)!</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<button 
  (click)="changeQ7()"> + What is the highest high school GPA possible?</button>
<div *ngIf="showQ7"> 
  <p>If your school uses an unweighted GPA system, then the highest possible GPA is 4.0. If your school uses a weighted GPA system, it's possible to even reach a GPA of 5.0, however it's highly unlikely.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <button 
  (click)="changeQ8()"> + Is high school GPA important for college?</button>
  <div *ngIf="showQ8"> 
  <p>High school GPA is probably one of the most important factors for college admissions. Many colleges have a minimun GPA requirement for admission. The importance of GPA to colleges varies from college to college. Some may emphasize GPA a lot while others may value other factors more. It is best you research individual colleges to understand their admission critieria to get a better understanding of this.</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<button 
  (click)="changeQ9()"> + If I have a low GPA, does that mean I cannot go to a good college anymore?</button>
<div *ngIf="showQ9">  
<p>A low GPA does present some pretty significant challenges for college admissions, however, that doesn't mean you have no chance of making it into a good college anymore. Colleges consider many factors when review applications including extracurriculat activities, essays, recommendation letters, and standardized test scores. However, a low GPA still does present some significant challenges, so you should still try to get a better GPA.</p>
